## Description  
The project aims to come up with a reliable analysis tool to reduce and optimize energy consumption of smart households. By providing an analytic web application that can pair with smart home control interfaces, the idea is to monitor the energy consumption and give not only comprehensible statistics of energy consumption of each device group, the cost of the electricity, but also provide a Machine-Learning based and detailed recommender system of which device/device group can be switched off to optimize the electricity cost without causing discomfort or dissatisfaction. Moreover, the website also involve kids. By giving out daily energy-saving challenges and "lucrative" rewards to kids, we can also educate them about energy saving and its impact to the future.
